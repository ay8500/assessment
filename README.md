# Assessment Project - Java, Spring MVC, jQuery

Welcome to the Assessment Project - Java, Spring MVC, jQuery

Here you find a short summary of your tasks. Please use this project "assessment" as your skeleton and add new sources to complete the tasks. When itÂ´s done please send us a .zip via mail of the complete project, so we can check what you have done.

## Tasks

Create a new site where users are able to:

1. Create notes via an input field.
2. Notes can be submitted to the server by clicking a button "Send" which does its work by utilizing the AJAX capabilities from jQuery.
3. All notes are displayed below the input field.
4. Notes have a max length of 100 characters.
5. Notes must be saved on the server so that they can survive a reboot.
6. JUnit tests should be available to test saving and loading notes.
7. The procedure of saving and loading a note should take place in a spring bean (eg. a service bean).
8. After a user saved a note, the list of notes below the input field gets refreshed via AJAX and displays the newest set of notes from the server.

**Good luck!**
